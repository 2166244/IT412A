ISSUES/PROBLEMS:
	Monitoring or tracking the growth of the plant is not an easy task among the farmers. There are some proper methods that needs to apply such as an adequate nutrients for them to grow healthy and strong. One of these nutrients is the inorganic fertilizer which is common nowadays as food supplement for plants. The issue of using inorganic fertilizers is that some farmers are not able to monitor their plants properly which results of too much consumption of inorganic fertilizers. In this case, the cost of it will be expensive and one-fourth of the whole proportion of their investment will be pay for the inorganic fertilizer. Too much consumption of the inorganic fertilizer will lead to higher expenses.

Other problems/challenges are the following:
Information among farmers are not readily available for them, so, they are in need to go to offices of Department of Agriculture within their town. And this take a lot of time and at the same costly.
Information broadcast on radio and TV programs is not sufficient or does not specify for the farmerâ€™s personal needs. Information for them should be available anytime.
Knowledge among farmers should be up-to-date for them to apply in their farming.
Field agents of fertilizer companies are not able to timely visit farmers for them to guide on how they can properly monitor their plants by supplying inorganic fertilizers to the plants.

SOLUTION:
 As a solution to the problem stated, we came up a project which is named iGROW. This mobile application is intended for farmers for them to monitor or track the growth of their plants. The application will benefit especially the farmers. For the reason that  they can lessen their expenses buying inorganic fertilizers and can monitor properly by maintaining their plants healthy until the time of harvesting came.


The following are the list of different features that can help the farmers such as:
Calendar (Growth, Harvest, Fertilization): This feature includes the timeline of when the plants are given/supplied an inorganic fertilizers, pesticides and also the day of harvesting.
Productive Tips: Gives an idea on how farmers can properly take care of their plants. Also, in this feature the farmers will also have an idea on what plants are applicable for the season.
Offers: This include the market rates and offers a seller a probable buyer for their plants.


	With the help of the iGROW mobile application, farmers can have a lot of information and ideas which can they use or apply for their plants in an up-to-date manner. In this case, this will result to a healthy plants and also a wealthy income. Plenty of the fruits/vegetables will also be harvested. And this will result to a good profit which can provide an opportunity for a lot of farmers to increase/level up their fields and crop selections.
